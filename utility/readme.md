# Video Stabilization Utility

There are some utility for asisiting video stabilization development, ex. logger, sensor calibration, camera motion analysis ...etc. 

These utilities are:

- gyro_bias_calculation
  
    the utility to calculate gyro 3 asix bias 

- gyro_video_time_alignment
  
    to calculate the time bias between gyro data and video 

- log_calibration
  
    calibrate log to synchronize the time between gyro and video

- logger_and_parser
  
    logger and parser for eis dataset
  
- log_validation
  
    basic validation for gyro and video sample rate accuracy

- motion_estimation
  
    calculate motion from a video

- report_generator
  
    generate power point report of video stabilization simulation result 

- vidhance_log_utility
  
    log utility for vidhance calibration log

- vid_stab_analysis
  
    the analysis for video stabilization simulation result
